# Time_Series_Analysis


## Coal Dataset
Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are expressed in parts per million (ppm) and reported in the preliminary 1997 SIO manometric mole fraction scale.

## Plotting Coal Dataset Years 59 ~ 97

### Residual Analysis


There is systematic deviation from normality in the tails of the qqplot, residuals are not exactly normaly distributed.

#### Histogram

Residuals seem to follow a normal distribution.

#### QQplot

There is systematic deviation from normality in the tails of the qqplot, residuals are not exactly normaly distributed.

#### Residual Plots over Time

The residual plot on the left clearly shows a U-shaped pattern. Thus vioaliting the normality assumptions.

The residual plot on the right, has been zoomed to two years. The zig-zag pattern can be seen once the time frame is shorter.
